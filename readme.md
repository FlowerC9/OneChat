### Getting Started 🚀

To get started with OneChat, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/FlowerC9/OneChat`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd OneChat`

### Setting Up Environment Variables 🌐

Before starting the application, ensure you set up the necessary environment variables. Both the frontend and backend have a `.env.example` file provided. Follow these steps:

1. **Copy the provided `.env.example` file**: Use this file to create your own `.env` file in both the frontend and backend directories.
   
2. **Update `.env` with your credentials**: Open the `.env` file in each directory (`frontend` and `backend`) and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and secrets. This includes API keys, database URLs, and any other sensitive information required by the application.

3. **Set up Firebase Admin credentials**:
   - In the `backend/src` directory, create a file named `firebase-admin-cred.json`.
   - Place your Firebase service account credentials in this file. Ensure the path to this file matches the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in your `.env` file. For example:
     ```
     GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=src/firebase-admin-cred.json
     ```
   - If you choose a different name or path for the credentials file, make sure the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable reflects this.

4. **Save and verify**: Save the `.env` files once you have updated them with your details. Verify that all necessary variables are correctly set to ensure the application functions as intended.

5. **Important**: Do not commit your `.env` files to version control systems like Git (ensure they are listed in your `.gitignore` files).

### Installing Dependencies and Starting the Application 🛠️

Now that you have set up your environment variables, proceed with the following steps to install dependencies and start the frontend and backend servers:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the frontend development server: `npm run dev`
   - Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to access the frontend application.

2. **Backend**:
   - Open another terminal (or split your terminal window if supported) and navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd ../backend`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the backend server: `npm run dev`
   - Ensure the backend server is running correctly to support the frontend functionalities.

### Tip: Using Split Terminals

To manage frontend and backend servers simultaneously:

- **VS Code**: Right-click on the terminal and choose "Split Terminal." Navigate to the frontend and backend directories in separate terminals for easy monitoring.


### Running the Application with Docker 🐳

You can also use Docker to containerize and run OneChat. Follow these steps to set up and run the application using Docker:

1. **Build and Start Containers**:
   - Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory: `cd OneChat`
   - Build and start the containers: `docker-compose up --build`

2. **Access the Application**:
   - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
   - The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
   - MongoDB will be available at `mongodb://localhost:27017`

3. **Stopping the Containers**:
   - To stop the containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `docker-compose` is running.
   - Alternatively, you can run: `docker-compose down` to stop and remove the containers.
